This is a Python script used to integrate data from an Epicor 9.05 MSSQL database into [Workfront](http://workfront.com). This is a generic version of code that was orignally developed and tested inside a private intranet. Data from Epicor had been previously integrated with JIRA using the [Kepler Database Custom Field](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.keplerrominfo.jira.plugins.databasecf) plugin, and the goal of this script was to replicate similar functionality in Workfront. This is only useful as an example for others attempting to develop similar integrations. It was infuriating to figue out how to make this work, as some essential aspect of the API were not well documented. More details on useful resources are embedded in the code.
